  <font size=+3>W</font>hile Americans recognize and celebrate collective achievements such as the writing of the Declaration of Independence, victory in the Revolutionary War, or the landing of a man on the Moon -- it is individual accomplishment that is cherished the most. The "stars" of the aforementioned events -- Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, and Neil Armstrong -- outshine the collective constellation. One person's contribution <b><i>can</i></b> define the course and meaning of history.<p>
  <font size=+3>B</font>etsy Ross sewed the first American flag. When we view the flag, we think of liberty, freedom, pride, and Betsy Ross. The American flag flies on the moon, sits atop Mount Everest, is hurtling out in space. The flag is how America signs her name.<p>
  <font size=+3>I</font>t is no surprise that Betsy Ross has become one of the most cherished figures of American History.<p>

<b><img src="../red.gif" width="10" height="10"> What do the red, white, and blue of the flag represent?<br>
</b><ul><ul> The Continental Congress left no record to show why it chose the colors. However, in 1782, the Congress of the Confederation chose these same colors for the Great Seal of the United States and listed their meaning as follows: white to mean purity and innocence, red for valor and hardiness, and blue for vigilance, perseverance, and justice. According to legend, George Washington interpreted the elements of the flag this way: the stars were taken from the sky, the red from the British colors, and the white stripes signified the secession from the home country. However, there is no official designation or meaning for the colors of the flag.<p>
</ul></ul><b><img src="../red.gif" width="10" height="10"> Who designed the flag?<br>
</b><ul><ul> Betsy Ross sewed it, but who designed it? The answer, according to the experts at the Betsy Ross house, is that it was possibly designed by Francis Hopkinson, a New Jersey delegate to the Continental Congress and a signer of the Declaration of Independence.<p>
</ul></ul><b><img src="../red.gif" width="10" height="10"> Why are the stars in a circle?<br>
</b><ul><ul> The stars were in a circle so that no one colony would be viewed above another. It is reported that George Washington said, "Let the 13 stars in a circle stand as a new constellation in the heavens."<p>
</ul></ul><b><img src="../red.gif" width="10" height="10"> Why would Betsy Ross be chosen to make the flag?<br>
</b><ul><ul> It was usual in that day for upholsterers to be flagmakers. As Betsy Ross prayed in the pew next to George Washington and was a niece of George Ross, it is not hard to believe that these members of the Flag Committee formed by the Continental Congress would call upon Betsy Ross to make the flag.<p>
</ul></ul><b><img src="../red.gif" width="10" height="10"> Was this her house?<br>
</b><ul><ul> It is known that Betsy Ross rented rooms here. At the time of the flag creation, she was either here at 239 Arch Street or next door at 241 Arch, where the garden is now. House numbers on her street between the years 1785 and 1857 were registered using three different numbering systems, making the determination very tricky. If you are interested in historical detective work, you'll enjoy the methodical, historical approach used by experts: check out the <a href="../prove239.html">Was this her house?</a> page.<p>
</ul></ul><b><img src="../red.gif" width="10" height="10"> Where is the first flag?<br>
</b><ul><ul> No one knows what happened to the first flag. Very few flags from that time have survived.<p>
</ul></ul><b><img src="../red.gif" width="10" height="10"> Why is the flag called "Old Glory"?<br>
</b><ul><ul> In 1831, Captain William Driver, a shipmaster from Salem, Massachusetts, left on one of his many world voyages. Friends presented him with a flag of 24 stars. As the banner opened to the ocean breeze, he exclaimed, "Old Glory." He kept his flag for many years, protecting it during the Civil War, until it was flown over the Tennessee capital. His "Old Glory" became a nickname for all American flags.<p>
</ul></ul><b><img src="../red.gif" width="10" height="10"> What is a vexillologist?<br>
</b><ul><ul> A vexillologist is an expert on flags and ensigns. A vexillum (plural vexilla) is a military standard or flag used by ancient Roman troops.<p>
<a name="faq8">
</ul></ul><b><img src="../red.gif" width="10" height="10"> Many people discover among their family relics a certificate from the American Flag House and Betsy Ross Memorial Association. What is it?<br>
</b><ul><ul> Over two million of these certificates were sold starting in 1898 in order to raise funds needed to preserve the Betsy Ross House. These certificates were receipts or "thank-yous" for contributions of 10 cents. The Association went out of business in 1935. The only "value" to these is the knowledge that the recipient participated in the preservation of the Betsy Ross House.</ul></ul>
