<h1 align="center"><b>Your Assignment</b></h1>
<p align="left"><b>Inevitably as a math teacher, I hear the question, &quot;But
how will I ever use this information in the real world?&quot;&nbsp; The purpose
of this web site was to illustrate&nbsp;that even as familiar a symbol as the American Flag exhibits geometric concepts.</b></p>
<p><b>You are almost 75% done with the study of Geometry this year.&nbsp;
Hopefully your perspective has changed with your new geometric knowledge.&nbsp;
I suspect you see the world through new eyes.&nbsp; Hopefully you now see
geometric relationships in common objects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Your assignment, therefore, is to select a common object, from your
everyday environment, interpret it from a geometric point of view, and
demonstrate
how that object exemplifies geometric principles.</b></p>
<p><b>You will work with two other people from the class (see team
assignments).&nbsp; You can choose any object(s) you like, and you can present
your findings to the class in any manner your team decides.&nbsp; Examples would
be: posters, websites, overhead, video, etc.&nbsp; You will be marked as a team
on Content, Organization, Creativity, Delivery or Presentation, and Geometric
Concepts.&nbsp; You will have 2-3 weeks to work on the project, with limited
classroom time made available to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>So put on your geometry bifocals, roll up your sleeves and get started,
and most important---ENJOY!</b></p>
