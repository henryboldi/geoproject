<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Most students of history know that Francis Scott Key and Colonel
John S. Skinner were on board a&nbsp; vessel in Baltimore's harbor on
September'13-14, 1814, when the British commenced a bombardment of Fort Henry
just off the shoreline.&nbsp; Both men searched anxiously throughout the night
for some sign of the American flag atop the Fort, but it was only by &quot;the
dawn's early light&quot;&nbsp; after the &quot;rockets red glare and the bombs
bursting in air&quot; that Key was able to discern that the Flag still
waved.&nbsp; According to history he then penned &quot;The Star Spangled
Banner&quot; on the back of a letter he had in his waistcoat pocket.&nbsp; The
tune he employed was &quot;Anacreon in Heaven,&quot; a popular song in 1814.</p>
<p>The original &quot;Star Spangled Banner&quot; which Key so gratefully saw
still flying over Fort McHenry is still preserved today.&nbsp; It originally
measured<b> thirty by forty two feet</b>.&nbsp; (<b>What was its area, perimeter
and the length of its diagonal?)</b>&nbsp; A seamstress, Mary Young Pickersgill,
had been commissioned to make the flag and was handsomely paid $450.90 for her
services.&nbsp; She utilized 400 yards of first quality hand-woven wool bunting
for the project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though the flag remained in the possession of the family of the Lieutenant
Colonel who commanded Fort McHenry for&nbsp; a century, in 1914 it was gifted to
the Smithsonian Institute in Washington D.C.&nbsp; It was in great need of
preservation, and several women experienced in&nbsp; needlework undertook the
task.&nbsp; In so doing they had to stitch a linen backing and reinforce stripe
stitching.&nbsp; The historic flag had to be cut down to <b>twenty</b> <b>eight
by thirty two feet. ( Is this still proportional to the original measurements?)</b></p>
<p>Today this &quot;Star Spangled Banner&quot; is still on permanent exhibition
in the Smithsonian.&nbsp; It is an emblem of honor, of sacrifice, of liberty and
it evokes the same love of country today as it did when Francis Scott Key
&quot;so proudly hailed&quot; that &quot;our flag was still there.&quot;</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Answers:</font> Area 1260 square feet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Perimeter 144 linear feet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Diagonal 51.61 feet (By the Pythagorean Theorem)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The preserved flag is no longer proportional to the original flag (product of
the means does not equal product of the extremes.</p>
