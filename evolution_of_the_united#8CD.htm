<h1>Evolution of the United States Flag</h1>
</center>
<p>No one knows with <b>absolute certainty</b> who designed the first stars and
stripes or who made it. Congressman <a href="http://www.usflag.org/francis.hopkinson.html">Francis
Hopkinson</a> seems most likely to have designed it, and few historians believe
that&nbsp;<a href="about.betsy.ross.html"> Betsy Ross</a>, a
Philadelphia seamstress, made the first one.
<p>Until the Executive Order of June 24, 1912, neither the order of the stars
nor the <span style="background-color: #FF0000"><u><b>proportions </b></u></span>of
the flag was prescribed. Consequently, flags dating before this period sometimes
show unusual arrangements of the stars and odd<span style="background-color: #FF0000">
proportions</span>, these features being
left to the discretion of the flag maker. In general, however, straight (<span style="background-color: #FF0000"><u><b>collinear</b></u></span>)
rows of stars and <span style="background-color: #FF0000">proportions</span> similar to those later adopted officially were
used. The principal acts affecting the flag of the United States are the
following:
<p>&nbsp;
<ul>
  <li>On June 14, 1777, in order to establish an official flag for the new
    nation, the Continental Congress passed the <b>first Flag Act</b>:
    &quot;Resolved, that the flag of the United States be made of thirteen
    stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in
    a blue field, representing a new Constellation.&quot;
  <li>Act of January 13, 1794 - provided for 15 stripes and 15 stars after May
    1795.
  <li>&nbsp;Each time a state was added to the Union an additional star and
    stripe was added to the design which soon became cumbersome and unwieldy.</li>
  <li>Act of April 4, 1818 - provided for 13 stripes and one star for each
    state, to be added to the flag on the 4th of July following the admission of
    each new state, signed by President Monroe.
  <li>Executive Order of President Taft dated June 24, 1912 - established
    proportions of the flag and provided for arrangement of the stars in six
    horizontal rows of eight each, a single point of each star to be upward.
  <li>Executive Order of President Eisenhower dated January 3, 1959 - provided
    for the arrangement of the stars in seven rows of seven stars each,
    staggered <u><b><span style="background-color: #FF0000">horizontally and
    vertically.</span></b></u>
  <li>Executive Order of President Eisenhower dated August 21, 1959 - provided
    for the arrangement of the stars in nine rows of stars staggered
    horizontally and eleven rows of stars staggered vertically.<br>
